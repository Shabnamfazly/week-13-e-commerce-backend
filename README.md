# week-13-e-commerce-backend

## DESCRIPTION
This particular e-commerce application is crafted using initial code to establish the foundation of a back-end system for an online retail platform. The application leverages a command line interface (CLI) along with object-relational mapping techniques to facilitate diverse forms of data manipulation, storage, and retrieval. These operations are executed through HTTP methods within the framework of a RESTful API.

The application harnesses the power of the Express.js API in tandem with Sequelize, which serves as the bridge for interaction with a MySQL database. This synergy facilitates the creation of a robust back-end infrastructure for a retail website.


## USAGE
Run on the command line:

npm i

npm run seed

npm start
